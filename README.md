ImIn App - The Attendance Tracking App

DESCRIPTION:

The ImIn App is a solution to track individuals required attendance to their organizationâ€™s events utilizing mobile technology. Features like distance/duration calculation to an event's location, make this app a great alternative to the regular ID card or QR code scanners. This app allows the user to check in/out of an event just by pressing a button on their mobile device. Many organizations (e.g. universities) currently depend on several computers and laser scanners to track, for instance, required attendance for residential students. Crowded bottlenecks could be avoided, and resources efficiently utilized with an app like ImIn.
